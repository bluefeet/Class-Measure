=head1 NAME

Class::Measure - Create, compare, and convert units of measurement.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Class::Measure::Length> for some examples.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class that is inherited by the Class::Measure 
classes.  This distribution comes with the class L<Class::Measure::Length>. 

The classes L<Class::Measure::Area>, L<Class::Measure::Mass>, 
L<Class::Measure::Space>, L<Class::Measure::Temperature>, 
and L<Class::Measure::Volume> are planned and will be added soon.

The methods described here are available in all Class::Measure classes.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $m = new Class::Measure::Length( 1, 'inch' );

Creates a new measurement object.  You must pass an initial 
measurement and default unit.

In most cases the measurement class that you are useing 
will export a method to create new measurements. For 
example L<Class::Measure::Length> exports the 
length() method.

=head2 unit

  my $unit = $m->unit;

Returns the object's default unit.

=head2 set_unit

  $m->set_unit( 'feet' );

Sets the default unit of the measurement.

=head2 value

  my $yards = $m->value('yards');
  my $val = $m->value;
  print "$m is the same as $val when in a string\n";

Retrieves the value of the measurement in the 
default unit.  You may specify a unit in which 
case the value is converted to the unit and returned.

This method is also used to handle overloading of 
stringifying the object.

=head2 set_value

  my $m = length( 0, 'inches' );
  $m->set_value( 12 ); # 12 inches.
  $m->set_value( 1, 'foot' ); # 1 foot.

Sets the measurement in the default unit.  You may 
specify a new default unit as well.

=head2 reg_units

  Class::Measure::Length->reg_units(
    'inch', 'foot', 'yard'
  );

Registers one or more units for use in the specified 
class.  Units should be in the singular, most common, 
form.

=head2 units

  my @units = Class::Measure::Length->units();

Returns a list of all registered units.

=head2 reg_aliases

  Class::Measure::Length->reg_aliases(
    ['feet','ft'] => 'foot',
    ['in','inches'] => 'inch',
    'yards' => 'yard'
  );

Register alternate names for units.  Expects two 
arguments per unit to alias.  The first argument 
being the alias (scalar) or aliases (array ref), and 
the second argument being the unit to alias them to.

=head2 reg_convs

  Class::Measure::Length->reg_convs(
    12, 'inches' => 'foot',
    'yard' => '3', 'feet'
  );

Registers a unit conversion.  There are three distinct 
ways to specify a new conversion.  Each requires three 
arguments.

  $count1, $unit1 => $unit2
  $unit1 => $count2, $unit2

These first two syntaxes create automatic reverse conversions 
as well.  So, saying there are 12 inches in a foot implies 
that there are 1/12 feet in an inch.

  $unit1 => $unit2, $sub

The third syntax accepts a subroutine as the last argument 
the subroutine will be called with the value of $unit1 and 
it's return value will be assigned to $unit2.  This 
third syntax does not create a reverse conversion automatically.
